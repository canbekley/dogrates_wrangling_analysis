The second source is a tsv file containing pre-made predictions about the dog’s breeds which could be identified through the given tweet ids. Since these two dataset didn’t contain any information about the favorite counts and retweet counts of each tweet, this information had to be gathered through a twitter api using the tweepy package for python. I stored this information with their respective tweet ids in a json formatted txt-file called `tweet_json.txt`.\n"

These issues have been documented separately at the end of the chapter in the notebook file, which are:\n",

Here I started by merging the three different data sets into one master data frame, while fixing any other tidiness issues by the way. I created the categorical predicted breed column on the basis of the prediction algorithm, with a confidence interval of 20% minimum. Since the minimum confidence for the breed predictions has been set very low, the error appearance is pretty high. This had to be kept in mind for the following analysis process.\n"
